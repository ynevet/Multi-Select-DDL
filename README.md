Multi-Select drop-down list with images using AngularJS
*******************************************************

I was recently requested to create multiple select drop-down list that'll also support images display.

As you probably know, the standard select HTML tag supports single-choice and text only.

Since no in-built support for this kind of behavior I had to implement it by myself and I choose the fantastic AngularJS MVC framework to do it, with a little help of jQuery.

I wanted to share my work with you so enjoy it.
