Multi-Select drop-down list with images using AngularJS
*******************************************************

This is a multi-select drop-down list which is also supports icons display.

As you probably know, the standard select HTML tag supports single-choice and text only.

Since there's no built-in support for this kind of behavior, I had to implement it by myself and I choose the fantastic AngularJS MVC framework to do it with a little help of jQuery code.

I wanted to share my work with you so enjoy it.
